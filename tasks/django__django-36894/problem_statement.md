# Email fail_silently, auth_user, auth_password are ignored when connection param provided

Most django.core.mail APIs take a `fail_silently` parameter which is intended to suppress errors during sending, as well as a `connection` parameter to provide a specific EmailBackend instance for sending. When `connection` is specified, `fail_silently` is ignored.

To reproduce, configure your email settings to cause an error (e.g., `EMAIL_HOST="not.a.real.host"`) and: 
```python
from django.core.mail import get_connection, send_mail

send_mail("subject", "body", None, ["to@example.com"])
# Correct behavior: raises socket.gaierror: [Errno 8] nodename nor servname provided, or not known

send_mail("subject", "body", None, ["to@example.com"], fail_silently=True)
# Correct behavior: returns 0 messages sent, doesn't raise an error

send_mail("subject", "body", None, ["to@example.com"], fail_silently=True, connection=get_connection())
# Bug: despite fail_silently=True, raises socket.gaierror
```
A similar problem exists with the `auth_user` and `auth_password` params to `send_mail()` and `send_mass_mail()`, which are also silently ignored when a `connection` is provided.

There is no safe way to set any of these options on a connection (EmailBackend instance) once it has been constructed. The correct way to achieve the desired behavior is move `fail_silently` and the other params into `get_connection()`: 

```python
send_mail("subject", "body", None, ["to@example.com"],
    connection=get_connection(fail_silently=True, username="auth_user", password="auth_password"))
```
**Suggested fix**

Django's email APIs should handle `fail_silently`, `auth_user` and `auth_password` params as an error when `connection` is also provided. This will involve:
- Changing the default from `fail_silently=False` to `fail_silently=None` to be able to distinguish the cases. (Don't forget EmailMessage.send().)
- Raising a TypeError when `connection is not None and fail_silently is not None`. Something like "fail_silently cannot be used with a connection. (Pass fail_silently to get_connection() instead.)"
- Converting fail_silently==None to False where the high level APIs call get_connection()
- Issuing similar error messages for `auth_user` and `auth_password` (which already default to None)
- Updating tests to cover the new behavior
- Updating docs to note the changed behavior (params that had been silently ignored with `connection` will now raise an error)
